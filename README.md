<h2> Slack Clone using ReactJs and Firebase</h2>

<h3> React </h3>
<ul>
  <li> React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</li>
  <li> React is used to build single page applications.</li>
  <li> React allows us to create reusable UI components.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Create Slack-clone:</h2>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Good knowledege of CSS and Html is must. A basic idea of reactjs and javascript is required. Need to have some coding background. All you need is a lot of dedication and enthusiasm, need to be calm and patient while your code gives an error, and have a learning attitude.<br></p>

<h3> Installation </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Install NodeJS - head to the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">link</a> and then install recomended for most user</li>
  <li>Install VSCode - <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">link</a></li>
  <li> open terminal and run (npm install) </li>
</ul>


<h2>Start Smart</h2>
Jump into your Vscode, open new terminal and run following command to set up environment-<br>
<h3> Seting Up environment </h3>
Open VS code, head to terminal and run following commands-<br>
- [] npm install -g create-react-app<br>
- [] npx create-react-app slack-clone<br>
- [] cd slack-clone<br>
- [] npm start<br>
<p>A new browser window will pop up with your newly created React App! If not, open your browser and type <b>localhost:3000</b> in the address bar.</p><br>
<p>Look in the slack-clone directory, and you will find an src folder. Inside the src folder, there is a file called App.js; this is where we will working on our slack-clone project. It returns the complete code to an empty tag (root). In this project we will be using  google firebase platform to gather data on back end and hosting. <a href="https://firebase.google.com/"> Firebase </a>is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications.</p>
